# Responsive Developer Portfolio

## About
A responsive rafactoring of my original developer portfolio. This is a single-page application; content is stored in data.js so data can be updated without altering source code. This site was built with React.js and TailwindCSS

## Build the Project
Clone the github repo and open a terminal in the root directory. Install dependencies with `npm install` and start the development server with `npm start`
